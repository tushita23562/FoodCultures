          <p>This publication from Living Farms documents uncultivated foods consumed by Adivasi (indigenous) communities in two districts of Odisha – Rayagada and Sundargarh. A third of the population in six villages was selected and these households' intake was tracked over six months. The researchers recorded 121 different kinds of mushrooms, tubers, leafy vegetables, wild fruits & vegetables and wild animals collected, with consumption ranging from 12% to 24.4% of total cooked foods. Interestingly, the study also reviews historical records that show there was never famine in this part of the country due to the Adivasi dependence on uncultivated foods.</p>

          <p class="italic">2021</p>
          <p>In this paper, Sudha Narayan describes the continuing importance of the free collection of foods to diversifying diets and improving nutrition security by analysing food consumption data in the National Sample Surveys (NSS) of 2009-10 and 2011-12. She finds that, though there has been a rapid decline in the population that consumes free foods (5.8% compared to 12% in 2004-05), in districts where free foods are important, 15% of households collect food.</p>

          <p class="italic">2017</p>
          <p>This ethnographic study traces dietary changes in the Kumaon Hills, Uttarakhand. The author, Carly Nichols, spent a few months in four villages of Nainital district, lived with three families and conducted 72 semi-structured interviews on agricultural production and household consumption. She found a transition away from madua or finger millet, which is considered dark and undesirable, towards packaged foods such as Maggi noodles. Milk consumption has fallen as most of the milk produced is sold through dairies. The author recommends that quantitative methods that can show what has changed in diets should be combined with qualitative that show how these changes occurred.</p>

          <p class="italic">2010</p>
          <p>This review paper examines the importance of wild foods in communities across the world. It starts off by debunking the premise that human civilisation moved from hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a complete agricultural one, using the term cultivator-hunters or farmer-foragers to describe communities that shape their non-agricultural environment in various ways. It talks about the 'hidden harvest' of wild foods, including those that are found in cultivated land such as paddy fields. It describes the diversity and nutritive value of wild foods, as well as the factors leading to their decline such as climate change, land use change, unsustainable harvesting etc. Another important factor is that the consumption of wild foods is considered shameful in wider society. This is in spite of the fact that globally, over 1 billion people consume wild foods</p>

          <p class="italic">2000</p>
          <p>This paper describes the access to CPRs for the poor, with findings from seven villages throughout Bengal. The authors found that, along with fuel and fodder, food is also collected - fish and greens from paddy fields, fish and prawn from privately owned tanks and fruits and meat from the forests. Agricultural intensification, population growth and environmental degradation have led to decline in CPRs. Further, new forms of community-based resource management, such as a fishermen's cooperative society has resulted in the conversion of open access resources into 'private' property. Thus, processes of modernisation which take over from customary access have not been kind to poor communities.</p>

          <p>NS Jodha spent decades researching the importance of Common Property Resources (CPR) for the rural poor. This seminal work documents findings from 80 villages in 21 districts and seven states (now eight) of India. While he considers all these dry regions, it must be noted that some have rainfall comparable to western Avadh, such as Vidisha, MP. The paper describes how CPRs reduced inequity by providing resources to the poor, and discusses various factors that have led to their decline </p>
